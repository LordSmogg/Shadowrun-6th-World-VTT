So what is this:
Lacking a foundry system for Shadowrun 6th edtion, I modified a 5th edition system to align it as close as i could to 6th without having to go too deep into coding. Basically i just wanted something that worked. 

Updates from 5th -> 6th:
- Rolls on the character sheet (Memory, Judge ect)
- Skills updated to 6e. Support for dodge and block.
- Edge updated so the bar always goes to 7. 
- Push the limit now deduct 4 edge.
- Firering mode was adjusted to deduct the right amount of bullets and add Damage.
- Environment Conditions does no longer affect dice pool automatically.
- Cover levels 1-4 added for defense bonus dice.
- Spell damage works more in line with 6th edtion.
- AmpUp will display as AmpUp instead of Power and add to spell damage and drain.
- Some display of limits and recoil removed.

Reccomendations:
- Toggle not using limits in the setting.
- Use descriptions for Attack Ratings.
- You might want to make an action to display Defense Rating.
- Toggle firering mode on weapon rather than the pop-up.
- Set the combat tracker to display edge value.

So in short, many things were adjusted to make it playable for 6th edtion, but its not perfect, and I dont expect to mantain it much. 

The guys at RPG Framework are doing great progress on another Shadowrun 6th Edtion System for VTT, so I reccomend you check that out as well: https://www.rpgframework.de/index.php/en/welcome-to-rpg-framework/
