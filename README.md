So what is this:
Lacking a foundry system for Shadowrun 6th edtion, I modified a 5th edition system to align it as close as i could to 6th without having to go too deep into coding. Basically i just wanted something that worked. 

So what was changed:
- Rolls on the character sheet (Memory, Judge ect)
- Skills updated to 6e. Support for dodge and block.
- Remember to toggle not using limits in the setting. I have also removed some of the places limits are displayed.
- Attack and Defense ratings are missing. I reccomend putting those in descriptions.
- Edge was tricky since you can now always go to 7 edge, I reccomend setting your edge as your base edge and then adding edge adjustment to reach 7. I have adjusted the edge roll to only roll from base edge. Its not so pretty but it works for the purpose of playing. 
- Firering mode was adjusted to deduct the right amount of bullets.
- Conditions does no longer affect dice pool.
- Spell damage works right for direct spells

So in short, many things were adjusted to make it playable for 6th edtion, but its not perfect, and I dont expect to mantain it much. 

The guys at RPG Framework are doing great progress on another Shadowrun 6th Edtion System for VTT, so I reccomend you check that out as well: https://www.rpgframework.de/index.php/en/welcome-to-rpg-framework/
